	<h1 id="header1">CSS Box Model</h1>
	<p class="text" >
		On a web page, everything display by <em>CSS</em> is a box, wether some line of text or a box that uses border radious to look like a circle.
	</p>
	<h3>Content and Sizing</h3>
	<p class="text-2">
		In CSS, boxes have diffeent behavior base on their display value, their set dimensions, and also the content embeded within them which can be boxes generated by child element, or just text. This can be control by using either <em>extrinsic sizing </em>that allow you control the way you want your content or  allowing the browser make desition for you bose on the content size by using <em>intrinsic sizing. When content is too big for the box it is in, it's call overflow and we can manage how an element handles overflow content, using the overflow property.</em>
	</p>

	<h3>The area of the Box Model</h3>
	<p class="text-3">
		Boxes are made up of distinct box model areas that all do a specific job.These boxes are the margin box, border box, padding box and content box. <br>
		<img class="img" src="boxmodel.jpg">
		<ol id="list">
			<li>
				 content box is the area that the content lives in.This content can control the size of its parent, so is usually the most variably sized area.
			</li>

			<li>
				The padding box surrounds the content box and is the space created by the padding property. Because padding is inside the box, the background of the box will be visible in the space that it creates. If our box has overflow rules set, such as overflow: auto or overflow: scroll, the scrollbars will occupy this space too.
			</li>

			<li>
				The border box surrounds the padding box and its space is occupied by the border value. The border box is the bounds of your box and the border edge is the limit of what you can visually see. The border property is used to visually frame an element.
			</li>

			<li>
				The final area, the margin box, is the space around your box, defined by the margin rule on your box. Properties such as outline and box-shadow occupy this space too because they are painted on top, so they don't affect the size of our box. You could have an outline-width of 200px on our box and everything inside and including the border box would be exactly the same size.
			</li>
		</ol> 
	</p>
	<h3>Controlling the Box Model </h3>
	<p class="text-4">
		To understand how to control the box model, first, theres a need to understand what happens in your browser. <br>Every browser applies a user agent stylesheet to HTML documents. The CSS used varies between each browser, but they provide sensible defaults to make content easier to read. They define how elements should look and behave if there's no CSS defined. It is in the user agent styles where a box's default display is set, too. For example, if we are in a normal flow, a _div_ element's default display value is block, a _li_ has a default display value of list-item, and a <span> has a default display value of inline. <br>An inline element has block margin, but other elements won't respect it. Use inline-block, and those elements will respect the block margin, while the element maintains most of the same behaviors it had as an inline element. A block item will, by default, fill the available inline space, whereas a inline and inline-block elements will only be as large as their content. <br> Alongside an understanding of how user agent styles affect each box, you also need to understand box-sizing, which tells our box how to calculate its box size. By default, all elements have the following user agent style: box-sizing: content-box;. <br>Having content-box as the value of box-sizing means that when you set dimensions, such as a width and height, they will be applied to the content box. If you then set padding and border, these values will be added to the content box's size.
